"""
This is the main file where we created
the interaction between the user and the
database of bassists.
We used the argparse module to configure
all the positional and optional arguments.
Depending on the arguments given,
the program leads the user to a series of steps
to either check the presence of bassist or of the
band inside the database and/or add them to it.
There is also the possibility to check out
the association between bassists and bands.
